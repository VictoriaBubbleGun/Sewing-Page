            <h2>Obsession with Sewing</h2>
            <h3>A Hobby with a long History</h3>
            <p>
              The art of sewing is at least 20,000 years old. Ancient peoples
              joined pieces of material using bone and horn needles and animal
              sinew for thread. Around the 14th century iron needles were
              invented, and by the 15th century there were eyed needles. Later
              sewing needles were made of steel, as they still are today. In the
              1800s the first practical sewing machine appeared, and today most
              sewing is done by machine, though some sewers still choose to
              perform fine sewing and finishing by hand. <br />
              For me sewing holds a special place in my heart because I cherish
              the feeling of donning garments I've meticulously crafted myself.
              The knowledge that I'm wearing something truly unique, an
              expression of my personal style and creativity, brings a sense of
              pride that's unmatched. Moreover, the sustainability of sewing is
              a core reason for my affection. By repurposing fabrics, upcycling
              old clothes, and reducing waste, I'm contributing to a more
              eco-friendly way of dressing, aligning with my values and making a
              positive impact on the planet.
